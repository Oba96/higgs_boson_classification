# higgs_boson_classification
Accelerated Machine Learning project

We were tasked by CERN to research and develop an implementation plan for an  accelerated  classification  model  to  automatically  discriminate  between  a  signal  process  which produces  Higgs  bosons  and  a  background  process  which  does  not. In the project we implemented our solution using the RAPIDS accelerated framework.
